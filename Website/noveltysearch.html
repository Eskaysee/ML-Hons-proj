      <h3>What is Novelty Search?</h3>
      <p>Novelty Search is an evolutionary algorithm that rewards robotic agents in a swarm for performing a atypical, extraordinary or abnormal behaviour instead of based on 
        an objective fitness functions. This is especially useful when solving problems that have seemingly clear solutions. For example the goal of the Chinese finger trap is
        to free your fingers. It is ones naturally one would instinctively want to just pull your fingers away from each other (the objective), however this would further entrap your fingers.
        Only when attempting something unusual or unique, like alternating between pushing your fingers closer together and pulling them further apart is one finally
        able to free their fingers.
      </p> 
      
      <br>

      <p>In the context robots in a swarm, novelty search aids in providing an additional method of evaluating evolutionary algorithm solutions besides only using 
        the objective fitness function. This promotes a more lateral approach to problem solving. This also promotes behavioural diversity as original behaviour is
        encouraged.

          <h3 class="text-center">Experiment Goals & Methods</h3>
          <p>The aim of our research is to optimise the speed robots adapt to changes in their environment, whilst still maximising the efficiency of objective
            completion through generating cooperative behaviour.
            We aimed to achieve this through hybridizing two evolutionary algorithms, Novelty Search and mEDEA algorithm.
            In a simulation, robots were tasked with foraging while also looking for mates to pass on its genes (behaviour). There were 3 types of resources:
            A (light), B (intermediate) & C (heavy). Type A required one robot to push it, type B 2 and type C 3. For each environment the experiment was run 3 times eachtime alternating robot controllers designs.
            these designs involved mEDEA with random selection, fitness-based mEDEA algorithm and the mEDEA algorithm hybridised with novelty search. Every robot also had 
            hueristics to follow under certain conditions (pick up, ditch, transport and drop resource). Every robot also had a fitness
            funtion the measured the sum of the value of the resources a robot stored. Resource A was worth 1, resource B worth 2 & resource C worth 3.
            This was run in 2 seperate environments, each run several times.
            The first one involved 200 robots and 100 resources of varying types in an arena. The large number of robots chosen for this environment was to ensure
            robot deaths were minimised. The large number of resources was to ensure as many robots as possible encounter at least one resource.
            The second environment was more sparse and there were only 100 robots and 50 resources. It starts off with just 15 resources for the first 5 generations
            then an additional 35 resources are added in the following 5 generations. This was to give the robots time to adapt and explore the environment before having to
            gather the bulk of the resources. This was also to measure how well robots adapted to changes in their environment. The time taken to store resources
            was measured in the first and the last 5 generations for comparison.
            Thus we measured:
            <li>The number of active robots</li>
            <li>The value of the resources gathered</li>
            <li>The time taken to store resources in the earlier and later generations</li>
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Tools & Experiment Parameters</h3>
          <p>The robot simulator, called roborobo was used to run our experiments. It simulated e-puck robots. The simulator was extracted from Nicholas Bredeche GitHub repository. A lot of the
            physics for how resources and robots interacted with the environment was built in and mostly coded using C++ and uses the SDL2 graphics library. The
            code concerning the experiments was coded in python. Below are some of the experiment parameters:

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        In the first environment, the novelty search-based mEDEA hybridised algorithm had slightly more active robots than the fitness based algorithm (see Figure 1)
        and stored slightly more resources than the random based algorithm (see Table 2). This was possibly due the novelty search mEDEA hybrid being better and handling
        the trade off between the mission objective (foraging resource) and the environment objective (exploring & spreading its genomes - what determines its behaviour).
        <br>
        The second experiment showed the novelty search-based mEDEA hybrid algorithm had the greatest improvement in time taken to gather resources, possibly indicating
        it being better at adapting to changes in the environment. The overall value of the resources were also values higher for the hybrid algorithm compared to the other
        two robot controller designs. This means more type B and C resources were gathered, thus indicating improved collaboration between robots. This was, however, a very
        slight improvement.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The results for The hybridised algorithm - mEDEA algorithm with Novelty Search align with the objectives of our research stated earlier.The
        effectiveness of the hybridisation should be tested further as the number of tests that were run for each controller in each environment was 
        minimal due to time constraints. Improvements were observed, although the degree of the improvements were less than satisfactory. The robot controllers
        also had room for improvement with regards to directly heading to the gathering zone (without detours) when collecting an object. These changes may produce more 
        concrete results.
        It would be of interest to the field of evolutionary swarm robotics collaborative problem solving to see how controllers using the
        hybridisation operate in collective formation tasks. This combined with foraging may be of great use for building
        construction in the future and could serve useful in physical robots.
