                    Map-elites is a quality diversity algorithm, a type of algorithm that focuses on creating a diverse collection of 
                    high-quality behaviours. The user chooses a performance measure for the simulation, then creates an N-dimensional 
                    feature space which will determine the variations of interest for the user. Each of the dimensions found in the 
                    feature space is then given a valuation, in order to determine a priority ranking, and over each generation the 
                    algorithm checks for the highest performing “cell” in the feature space to determine which are the best performing 
                    solutions of that generation. As shown in the images below, the image on the left represents a high-dimensional 
                    space and the image on the right represents the collection of possible candidate solutions. Where we can then 
                    search for local optima as the starting points for future generations of the swarm.

                <h6>Approach</h6>
                <p>
                  To carry out this experiment, a 2-D simulator called roborobo was used to simulate the physical environment, 
                  the resources and the robots in the swarm. For this experiment, two robot controllers were designed, one running 
                  the base mEDEA algorithm and the second running a hybrid algorithm of mEDEA and MAP-Elites. During the simulation, 
                  the robots communicate with each other and pass on their genomes to each robot them encounter.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Controller Design</h6>
                <p>
                  The controllers were designed with a set of heuristics to determine the general behaviour of each robot in the 
                  swarm, such as navigation, collection, abandoning tasks or waiting for help for certain tasks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Fitness Function</h6>
                <p>
                  A fitness function was designed for these functions which looked at the ability of each controller to explore 
                  its environment and to transport resources in the environment.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>Where TD is the total displacement of a robot from its starting position, MD is the maximum displacement a 
                   robot can move based on the size of the environment and RD is the resource distance which states how far a 
                   robot has travelled whilst pushing a resource.

                <h2 class="text-center">Implementation</h2>
                <h6>Experiment Design</h6>
                <p>
                  The experiment shall test the performance of the MEDEA algorithm against the hybrid algorithm at collective 
                  gathering tasks of increasing complexity. The experiment will test the capabilities of the swarm at locating 
                  and transferring resources in the environment to a predefined target area. The changing complexity will be 
                  done adding resources into the environment that require multiple robots in order to move in the environment, 
                  allowing for the collaborative ability of the swarm to be tested.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Environment Design</h6>
                <p>
                  The experiment shall be done in a virtual environment; this virtual environment is created from the roborobo 
                  simulator. The experiment shall occur in the same environmental conditions for all three complexity levels, 
                  which will be 2 dimensional, flat environment, which shall be call the testing arena.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Resource Design</h6>
                <p>
                  Resources can are designed to be one of three different categories, type A, B or C. Type A resources are 
                  designed to be moved by any number of robots, whereas type B requires 2 robots and type C requires 3 robots 
                  to move in the environment.

                  Results show that on average the hybrid algorithm do perform slightly better than the base mEDEA algorithm, 
                  but after performing a p-test, this improvement in performance is not considered significant enough of an 
                  improvement. This better performance can be accredited to the design of the MAP-Elites used to encourage the 
                  evolution of more variation in the swarm at later generations. I believe that there are improvements that can 
                  be made to the experiments and research I have done, changes to the robot controller design as well as more 
                  complex iterations of the MEDEA and MAP-Elites algorithm which could possible produce better results and that 
                  this future research should be conducted to explore the capabilities of it as an evolutionary algorithm for 
                  swarm robotics.
