            <h1>Novelty Search with Local Competition</h1>
            <p class="lead">Bailey Green</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Competition between agents is a powerful technique that is often used in artificial intelligence. Novelty Search with local competition aims to 
            expand on the behavioural-based approach of Novelty Search, where the aim is to find unique behaviours amongst the robots, by introducing competition among behaviours that 
            are similar. By having competition among behaviours that are similar, where the behaviour that performs the best at the designated task is selected, novelty search with local
            competition is able to improve on novelty search. It still benefits from finding unique behaviours resulting in diverse solutions but additionaly allows higher performing solutions.
            Novelty search and local compeition was hybridized with the mEDEA (environment-adaptation method) and compared against the mEDEA method in a collective gathering task.
            </p> 
            
            <br>

            <p>In the collective gathering task, 75 resources were randomly located in the environment and 100 robots then had to find and push those resources into the designated zone. 
              Three different sized resources were used, small, medium and large. The small, medium and large resources required one, two and three robots to push them respectively. 
              Using different proportions of these resources three task environments of easy, medium and hard difficulties were created. The hybrid novelty search with local competition
              method was than compared against the base mEDEA method on each of these task environments for 20 runs.  
            </p>

            <h3>Research Objective</h3>

            <p>The primary research objective for the paper is comparing the hybrid novelty search with local compeition method with mEDEA to determine the best
              method for evolving problem-solving collective behaviour and functional diversity in swarm robotics</p>

            <br>

            <p>The goal is to maximise the performance and diversity of the solutions while still providing environment adaptation. Various metrics were recorded in order to compare the
              performance and diversity between the two methods.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>

            <p>When comparing the performance the average maximum number of resources pushed into the gathering zone and the average time taken to complete the task for each task environment
              was compared between the two methods. As seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2, both methods performed very similarly. Upon conducting a independent t-test with a signifigance level of
              p=0.05, no significant difference between the performance of the two methods could be seen.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>The diversity was compared by looking at the average distance of the swarm to the center of the gathering zone for each task environment. The behavioural diversity was slightly
              harder to compare than the performance due to it being difficult to judge what classifies is a different behaviour. As can be seen in Figure 3, the results from this test were again 
              fairly similar however upon doing a independent t-test with a signifigance level of p=0.05, a difference between the methods in the easy and hard difficulty were found but not in the 
              medium difficulty. It is hard to interpret whether this results in a difference in behvaioural diversity. We concluded there was no difference in behavioural diversity due to not enough
              evidence being found. Further tests were done and the results of those are shown in the Github repo (link in the downloads page).
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>We concluded there was no significant difference in performance or behavioural diversity between the hybrid novelty search with local competition method and the mEDEA method for
              this collective gathering task. We still believe our hybridized method has the potential to outperform the mEDEA method in more complex tasks in which the strengths of novelty
              search and local competition will shine through. This is where we think further research needs to be done for determining the best method for evolving problem-solving collective 
              behaviour and functional diversity in swarm robotics.
