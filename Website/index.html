                <p class="text-center">Swarm robotics is a complex and constantly evolving field. It is an application of swarm intelligence which follows the
                  behaviours of a group of interacting agents. These agents have behavioural and functional diversity, which helps the
                  swarm in accomplishing their tasks. However, an issue with swarms is that they must be heavily configured for
                  environments to be effective at their tasks, thus the problem of using robotic swarms in unknown environments. A
                  solution to this is the use of evolutionary algorithms to evolve the swarms and allow them to adapt easily to
                  unknown environments.</p>
                  <br>
                <p class="text-center">In our project we will be designed and evaluated three different hybrid evolutionary methods to attempt to solve a simple
                  collective gathering task (figure shown below). In this task the swarm of robots must find and push resources randomly scattered across the environment into a designated zone.
                  The resources have three different sizes, small, medium and large, which require one, two and three robots to push respectively. Using combinations of These
                  resource sizes different complexities of the task could be created and tested.

                <h1 class="text-center">mEDEA Method</h1>
                <p class="text-center">The mEDEA, a minimal environment-driven distributed evolutionary
                  adaptation algorithm, provides a way of dealing with complex changing or unknown environments. It is the base 
                algorithm we will be hybridizing in all three research objectives (See Below)</p>

                <br>

                <p class="text-center">This algorithm is implemented by having a
                  genome which is controlling an agent throughout a generation.
                  Initially this genome is randomly initialized. Each generation the
                  genome is loaded onto the agent and as long as that genome is not
                  empty and the agent has energy, the agent will move around the
                  environment and broadcast its genome to other agents in a certain
                  proximity. At the end of each generation the
                  current genome is emptied. There are then three operators that are
                  then used to find a new active genome for each agent. The
                  selection operator finds a random subset from the list of genomes
                  the agent has received from other agents. The variation operator
                  then applies some mutation to these genomes in order to modify
                  them slightly. Usually, this modification is very minor. Finally, a
                  replacement operator is used to randomly select the new active
                  genome to control the agent for the next generation and the list of
                  genomes the agent received is emptied</p>

                  method for evolving problem-solving collective behaviour and functional
                  diversity in swarm robotics. To do this we each took the mEDEA method
                  and used it as base, combining it with other behaviour-based
                  evolutionary methods to form hybrid methods. The three hybrid methods
                  were then compared against mEDEA in a collective

                          <p>Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) expands on novelty search
                            by adding local competition where
                            agents which have similar
                            behaviours will compete against
                            one another. This allows NSLC to
                            have a high diversity while still
